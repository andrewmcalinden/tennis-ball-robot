AngularJS Application Skeleton
Above you have the skeleton (scaffolding) of a real life AngularJS, single page application (SPA).

The <html> element is the "container" for the AngularJS application (ng-app=).

A <div> elements defines the scope of an AngularJS controller (ng-controller=).

You can have many controllers in one application.

An application file (my...App.js) defines the application module code.

One or more controller files (my...Ctrl.js) defines the controller code.

A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.
