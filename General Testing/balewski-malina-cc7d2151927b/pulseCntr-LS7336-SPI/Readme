This 2 executables mimic the python code in 
../py-pulseCntr-SPI-LS7366-SPI/

rwMDR01.c
sets MDR), MDR1 register, reads the values back

rdCNTRviaOTR.c
also sets those 2 registers so pulser uses 2-byte word and counts 4 pulses per quadrature (the highest angular resolution)

Note,
you need to modify Makefile to compile one program or the other
