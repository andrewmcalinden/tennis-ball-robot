WARN - compilation of this simpletest code takes 2-4 minutes on Rpi - it is barely acceptable - only 1st time.

Code use:
A) generate TTree:
 root -b -q wrWtree.C

B) read it:
root -b -q rdWtree.C 


Complete example of define/write/reed TTree contains a  <vector>-lists.

Warn: on Raspberry-Pi compilation takes above 2 minutes

Body of the event-class  is defined in:
 Wevent2011.h 

It consist of list of vertices, each vertex is a list of tracks.

Operational one can unpack such event as:

Wevent2011	*myEvent=...
 printf("unpackEve() ID=%d  nVert=%d\n",myEve->id, (int)myEve->vertex.size());
 for(unsigned int iv=0;iv< myEve->vertex.size();iv++) {
    WeveVertex  *vert=&(myEve->vertex[iv]);
    printf("%d-vertex: Z=%f  nTrack=%d\n",iv,vert->z, vert->eleTrack.size());
    for(unsigned int it=0;it< vert->eleTrack.size();it++){
      WeveEleTrack *tr=&(vert->eleTrack[it]);
      printf("   Track  Pxyz=%.1f,%.1f,%.1f \n",tr->P.X(), tr->P.Y(), tr->P.Z());
    }
 }

resulting with:

print W2011event:  ID=12  nVert=2
 Vertex Z=202.0 cm  nTrack=2
   Track  Pxyz=2.0,0.0,2.0  PT=2.0  hitSect=40
   Track  Pxyz=3.0,0.0,3.0  PT=3.0  hitSect=41
 Vertex Z=302.0 cm  nTrack=3
   Track  Pxyz=-2.0,0.0,2.0  PT=2.0  hitSect=60
   Track  Pxyz=-3.0,0.0,2.0  PT=3.0  hitSect=61
   Track  Pxyz=-4.0,0.0,2.0  PT=4.0  hitSect=61


Note, this operation will NOT work under root CINT (inside .C macro). One MUST use the compiled C++ code to manipulate  those events (what is rather good).
The utility class  WeventIO demostartes how to do it:

class WeventIO {
  void fillEve(Wevent2011 *eve, int k);
  void unpackEve(Wevent2011 *eve);
};



To compile the code do:  make

It builds dynamic libary: libWtreeCode.so which can be loaded to regular root .C macro using:
 gSystem->Load("libWtreeCode.so");


'make clean' is provided as well. Note, perl needs to be installed on the machine to allow automatic generation of Dictionary and LinkDef.h .


The grand demonstration of the whole concept is with the following 2  root macros:

root -b -q  wrWtree.C
writes 4 events in to the branch "eveJan" file  "toyEve.tree.root". 
The TTree name is 'toy6D', the branch name is 'eveJan'

root -b -q  rdWtree.C
read all events form this file and print them using: unpackEve(Wevent2011 *eve)
The TChain name is 'toy6D', the branch name is 'eveJan'
It also draws one histogram with z-vertex
